        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese pho is all about the broth! In this authentic recipe, beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Beef Soup Bones: Use the shank and knee to make the homemade bone broth.</li>

                <li>Beef: This recipe calls for beef top sirloin. Make sure it's thinly sliced so the hot broth can cook it.</li>
